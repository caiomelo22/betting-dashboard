# Betting-Dashboard
Dashboard developed with Node.js and Nuxt.js in order to keep track of your past bets.

## Setup
To run the entire project, simply run the docker compose command:
`docker-compose up`

## Overview
To start the overview, I'm going to show you the dashboard page. This page gives you an overall of your bets. It shows the your success rate, ROI and a bunch of other statistics. In addition to that, there are a few charts, like the bet progression, profit by day and a few others.

To add bets to be tracked later in the dashboard, we have the Bets page. In this page you can track your past bets individually and add more bets.

In the Matches page, you can fill the results of the matches where you placed a bet. Once the result is updated, all of your bets outcomes are updated according to that result.

Thats the overview of the project, there is another Parlays page, where you can register you parlay bets, but the main core of the project was described here. Feel free to reach out if there are any comments of how to improve the plataform.
